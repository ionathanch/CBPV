  Join stacks and rejoining

  This is a proof widget used for the logical relations.
  Join stacks resemble just the join frames of CK stacks:
    J ::= □ | J[join j = γx. m in □]

  Rejoining a join stack onto a computation
  is dismantling the stack, or plugging into the innermost hole.
  The final computation must then have the following shape:
    join j₁ = γx. m₁ in ... join jᵢ = γx. mᵢ in m

  Join stacks satisfy two important properties:
  * (`rejoinDrop`): Rejoined terminals reduce to those terminals
    with the entire join stack dropped;
  * Rejoining (jump j v) drops j joins (as a de Bruijn index).

  The latter resembles the following:
    J[join 1 = γx. m₁ in ... join j = γx. mⱼ in jump j v]
    ⇒⋆ J[jump 0 v]
  Instead of proving it here,
  it gets combined with the logical relations,
  e.g. `ClosedSemantics.rejoinJump`.

  These definitions are isolated here instead of
  incorporated into Syntax and Evaluation
  because they are not really part of the surface syntax
  or evaluation rules of the language.
