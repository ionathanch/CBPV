# Call-by-Push-Value

This is a proof development on the metatheory of call-by-push-value,
which makes heavy use of mutual induction,
since the syntax of terms is mutually defined.

```
A ::= Unit | A + A | U B
B ::= A → B | B & B | F A

v ::= x | () | inl v | inr v | {v}
m ::= v! | λx. m | m v | return v | let x ← m in m
  | case v of {inl x => m; inr x => m}
  | (m, m) | m.1 | m.2
```

This means that everything from reduction to typing to the logical relation
are all mutually defined, and eliminating them generally requires mutual induction.

## Development structure and dependency graph

The structure of the proofs begins with the usual basics.

* RTC.lean: Reflexive, transitive closure of binary relations
* Syntax.lean: Syntax, renaming, substitution, and contexts
* Typing.lean: Typing rules, renaming, and weakening
* Evaluation.lean: Evaluation of (closed) commands,
  which doesn't evaluate under binders and branches
* CK.lean: CK machine semantics, with soundness and completeness
  with respect to evaluation
* Reduction.lean: Small-step reduction semantics for values and commands,
  which reduces everywhere to normal form

The primary goal of the development is to prove strong normalization:
all reduction paths are normalizing.

* NormalInd.lean: An inductive characterization of strongly normal and neutral terms,
  as well as a notion of strong reduction.
* NormalAcc.lean: The traditional definition of strong normalization
  as an accessibility predicate with respect to reduction.
* OpenSemantics.lean: A logical relation between types and sets of terms
  that are backwards closed with respect to strong reduction.
* Soundness.lean: Semantic typing, defined in terms of the logical relation,
  and the fundamental theorem that syntactic typing implies semantic typing.
* Normalization.lean: Syntactic typing implies semantic typing
  implies strong normalization (inductive)
  implies strong normalization (traditional).

Another goal is to show the correctness of an ANF translation of CBPV,
which requires showing its semantic equivalence.
* Equivalence: A logical equivalence between closed terms of a type
  with respect to evaluation of closed commands.
* Commutation: Various proofs that commands commute with configurations
  with respect to logical equivalence.
* ANF: The ANF translation into CBPV with commands and configurations,
  validity and type preservation proofs,
  and proving that A-normalized terms are logically equivalent to themselves.

Remaining proof files show interesting properties of CBPV.

* LeftmostOutermost.lean: A deterministic single-step reduction semantics
  based on strong reduction, proven to step to normal forms.
* ClosedSemantics.lean: A logical relations proof that closed, well-typed terms
  are strongly normalizing with respect to evaluation.
* CBV.lean, CBN.lean: Translations from STLC with fine-grained CBV and CBN semantics,
  along with proofs that they preserve well-typedness and CK machine semantics.
* Antisubstitution.lean (fails checking): An unused substitution lemma,
  similar to the antirenaming lemma.

## When to `@[simp]` and `@[reducible]`

Not all definitions are added to the default `simp` set.
As a general rule, a definition should be added if it is not a type-level term
and:

* It matches on an argument; or
* It does not match on an argument, but is not used in other definitions.

For instance, `Syntax.cons` matches on naturals,
and we want it to be in the simp set so that it reduces on constructors.
However, `Syntax.lift` doesn't match on an argument and is used in `Syntax.renameCom`,
so we don't want it to be in the simp set,
since it will always reduce too far when simplifying `renameCom`,
and prevent theorems about `renameCom` and `lift` from applying.
As another example, `ClosedSemantics.semCtxt` is used within `ClosedSemantics.semCom`,
so it shouldn't be in the simp set, but `semCom` itself can be.

Type-level definitions, especially recursive ones,
often represent predicates that could otherwise be encoded as inductives.
`ClosedSemantics.𝒱` and `ClosedSemantics.𝒞` are such definitions,
in contrast with the inductives `OpenSemantics.𝒱` and `OpenSemantics.𝒞`.
The definitions should be explicitly unfolded as needed,
corresponding with invoking `cases` on the corresponding inductives.
Otherwise, simplification may again reduce too far
and prevent theorems from applying.

Type-level definitions which are just type aliases
should be marked as `@[reducible]` so that instances for typeclasses
on the aliased types can be used.
In particular, definitions consisting of applications of `RTC.RTC`
need to be `@[reducible]` so that `calc` can find the `Trans` instances.
